I am currently a third-year PhD candidate at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), expected to graduate next year. My research focuses on reinforcement learning, intelligent traffic control, and machine unlearning. I earned my B.Eng. degree from Central South University of Forestry and Technology and pursued both my M.Eng. and PhD at BUPTâ€™s State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, under the supervision of Prof. Penghai Peng and Prof. Lixiang Li.

I have published four papers in top-tier international conferences and journals, with an additional four currently under review. My work explores cutting-edge topics in embodied intelligence, robotics, and autonomous driving, and I am actively seeking postdoctoral opportunities in these areas.

If you are interested in my research or would like to discuss potential collaborations or postdoctoral opportunities, please feel free to contact me via email. I warmly welcome inquiries!
