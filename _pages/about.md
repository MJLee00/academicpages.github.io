I am currently a third-year PhD candidate at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (**BUPT**), expected to graduate next year. During my PhD, I have collaborated with [Qiang Wu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=edUqF7sAAAAJ&hl=en) on traffic signal control, contributing to innovative solutions in this field. I earned my B.Eng. degree from Central South University of Forestry and Technology and pursued both my M.Eng. and PhD at BUPT’s State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, under the supervision of [Penghai Peng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pZqxzFoAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Lixiang Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xXyZ2VkAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). As a co-founder of Beijing City Intelligence, I have led the development of algorithms that have been successfully deployed at 40 intersections across three cities, demonstrating real-world impact. I am passionate about integrating academia and industry, aiming to translate my research into practical applications. 

I will be pursuing postdocresearch in **AI for Healthcare** at the **[ELLIS Institute](https://www.ellisinstitute.fi/)** with [Dr. Shaoxiong Ji](https://shaoxiongji.github.io/), and concurrently focusing on **AI for Security** at the **University of Technology Sydney** in collaboration with [Saber Yu](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Guangsheng.Yu), [Xu Wang](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Xu.Wang), and [Wei Ni](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GMS201gAAAAJ&hl=en). If you are interested in my research, potential collaborations, or postdoctoral opportunities, please feel free to contact me via email. I warmly welcome inquiries!
